Early Computing Devices
Attempts by humans to develop a tool to manipulate data go back as far as 2600 BC when the Chinese came up with the abacus. The slide rule was invented in 1621 and remained widely used until the emergence of electronic calculators in the 1970s. Both these examples of early devices were mechanical and on a human scale.

In 1830 the English mathematician Charles Babbage conceived an analytical engine, which could be programmed with punched cards to carry out calculations. It was different from its predecessors because it was able to make decisions based on its own computations, such as sequential control, branching and looping. Almost all computers in use today follow this basic idea laid out by Babbage, which is why he is often referred to as 'the father of computers.' The analytical engine was so complex that Babbage was never able to build a working model of his design. It was finally built more than 100 years later by the London Science Museum.
