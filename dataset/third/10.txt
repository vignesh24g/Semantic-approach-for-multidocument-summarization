Computers are devices that accomplish tasks or calculations in accordance to a set of directions, or programs. The first fully electronic computers, introduced in the 1940s, were voluminous devices that required teams of people to handle.In comparision to those new machines, today’s computers are astounding. They are not only thousands of times more expeditious, but also they can fit on your desk, on your lap, or even in your pocket. Computers are such an integral part of our everyday life now most people take them for granted.

Computers work through an interaction of hardware and software. The whole picture of the computer goes back to decades. However there are five apparent generations of computers. Each generation is defined by a paramount technological development that changes necessarily how computers operate – leading to more compressed, inexpensive, but more dynamic, efficient and booming machines.
