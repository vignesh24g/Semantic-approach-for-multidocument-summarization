Vitamin D nutrient is in the news more than ever for its greater implications during the time of Coronavirus pandemic. Health experts have raised concerns over the growing cases of vitamin D deficiency in general population as people are staying at home and are not able to obtain the 'sunshine vitamin' from natural sunlight. In fact, a new study discovered over 80% COVID-19 patients suffering from vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is known to aid many bodily functions and its insufficiency may lead to weak bones, heart-related ailments, low immunity and even respiratory problems.
The study that was published in 'The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism', found 80 percent of 216 COVID-19 patients admitted in a hospital in Spain to be vitamin D-deficient. The researchers also noticed that men had lower vitamin D levels than women.
"Vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, raised serum ferritin and troponin levels, as well as a longer length of hospital stay. We did not find any relationship between vitamin D concentrations or vitamin deficiency and the severity of the disease," wrote co-author Jose L. Hernandez, Ph.D., of the University of Cantabria in Santander, Spain.
Another recent study, published in 'Plos One' journal, had claimed that vitamin D sufficiency may lessen the oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients and fasten the treatment process. 
Vitamin D is also known as 'sunshine vitamin'. 
Apart from exposing yourself to sunlight regularly to obtain the vitamin naturally, a diet rich in foods with high vitamin D content may also help.
