The James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, was launched from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on December 25, 2021. The incredible telescope is now on its way to embark on a voyage to unearth the unknown facts behind the birth of the Universe. In the meantime, the Twitter profile of the NASA Webb Telescope engaged in a witty ‘blocking game’ with the Twitter profiles of NASA Sun, NASA Moon and NASA Earth. The funny banter will not only increase your knowledge about this one-of-a-kind telescope, it will also make you giggle.

The Twitter profile of the NASA Webb Telescope shared some screenshots of the Twitter profiles of NASA Sun, Moon and Earth that were blocked. Confused? Let us make it a bit simple for you.

The sunshield is installed on the Webb Telescope is made up of a material called Kapton where each layer is coated with aluminium to reflect the sun's heat back into space. Along with that, it is supposed to reflect back the heat and light from Earth and the Moon as well! That’s why the Twitter profile of the Telescope went ahead to ‘block’ the Sun, Moon and Earth from its list of followers.
